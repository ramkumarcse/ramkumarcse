<H3> Assignment 1 </H3>
<P>
Write a simple TCP client and server. 
Both the client and server will run on the same machine.
The client sends a succinct  greeting to the server and 
server responds. 

The server will be invoked with the command <br>
>> server serverport <br>
and the client with the command <br>
>> client serverIP serverport <br>

For the server, choose a port number between greater than 4000.

For the client determine the IP address of the server (which is also the 
IP address of the client!) and pass the argument serverIP as a 
character string in the dotted IP notation.

<H3> Assignment 3 </H3>
<P>
Write a simple TCP client that fetches HTML pages from web servers. 
<br>
The client will be invoked with the command (for example) <br>
>> webclient www.yahoo.com/ <br>
>> webclient www.msstate.edu/academics/ <br> 

The client should get the response from the HTTP server and print it on the 
screen.<br>
<p>
Hints: <br>

Parse the string into two parts  one before the first / and the rest <br>
For example for <br>   www.cse.msstate.edu/~ramkumar/cs4_6153.html <br> the 
first part is <br>  
www.cse.msstate.edu 
<br>
and the second part is <br>
/~ramkumar/cs4_6153.html <br>

Now create a TCP socket, <br>
get the IP address using gethostbyname() with the first part,<br> 
Establish connection with  port 80<br>

Send a HTTP request as contents of your data <br> 

For example, to fetch the page /~ramkumar/cs4_6153.html the request
should be <br>

GET /~ramkumar/cs4_6153.html HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: www.cse.msstate.edu\r\n
\r\n
