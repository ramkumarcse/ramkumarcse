Co-operative Systems are composed of components that need to co-operate with each other
to meet the requirements of the entire system. While <i> any </i> system can be seen as falling under this model, our concern (in this course) is restricted to large scale co-operative systems - failure of  which may be highly
consequential, and/or affect a large number of users who rely on the system. 
In this course we will discuss Security issues in co-operative systems.  

Some of the specific goals of this course are 

<UL>
<LI> Identifying examples of co-operative systems
<LI> Discussing security issues in such systems
<LI> Identifying strategies to address security issues
