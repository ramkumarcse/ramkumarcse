<H1> ALOHA Simulation </H1>
<p>
<H2> Due Tue, 28 April</H2>
</center>

Simulate slotted and plain ALOHA for a scenario involving 100 stations
transmitting to one  satellite.  
<p>
Make the following assumptions:
<ol>
<li> all packets are of the same size 
<li> the packet duration is one unit. 
<li> stations receive packets from their respective network layers. During
 any unit duration a station receives a packet (from its network layer) with
a probability <i>p </i>.
<li> time-out period is 25 units.
<li> after the timeout period, if no ACK is received, nodes wait for a random
amount of time (uniformly distributed between 1 and  25 units) before retransmission.
</ol>
<p>
Repeat simulations for different values of the  probability <i>p </i>.
<p>
 In each simultion estimate 
<ol>
<li> the throughput, 
<li> total packets generated by all stations, 
<li> total packets transmitted.
</ol>
<p>

If a station has multiple packets ready to be sent at any time (this can
happen if  there is a packet slated for retransmission and a new packet is
provided by the network layer, or if multiple packets are slated for
retransmission at the same time) the older packet is given preference.
