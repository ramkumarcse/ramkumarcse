System models are useful starting points for strategies employed to secure any system.  While many system models have been proposed, most of them aim to simply secure the operation of a single computer. In additon, existing system  models do not pay attention to how the assumptions behind the model can be validated. 

The goals of this course  are
<ul>
<li> review example system models, with focus of Clark-Wilson model.
<li> analyze the practical implications of the  assumptions underlying the CW model 
<li> come up with alternate models (to overcome the limitations of CW model)
<li> through group discussions, model a few sample systems using alternate models
</ul>


Tentative Schedule: 

<ul>
<li> Weeks 1:2:  Review of Background (students prepare for presenting any system model of their choice) 
<li> Weeks 3:4: Student presentations
<li> Weeks 5-6: Group discussions on limitations of existing models, and strategies to overcome limitations
<li> Weeks 7:14 TBD (group discussions and/or presentations on alternate models, modeling sample systems)
</ul>
