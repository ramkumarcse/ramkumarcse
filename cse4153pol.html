<P>Proficiency in C/C++ is assumed.   
 
</P>
<H2>Attendance</H2>
<P>All students (including auditors) are required to attend all
classes, and to present excuses for justifiable absences (<I>e.g.</I>,
attending a conference, or serious illness). This includes classes
given by guest lecturers.</P>
<P>Makeup for missed tests will only be
offered if scheduled in advance, unless the reason for the absence is
documented by a physician or a dean.</P>
<H2>Academic Honesty (<I>very important</I>)</H2>
<P>The <A HREF="http://www.msstate.edu/dept/audit/1207.html">departmental
policy</A> is included here by implication, and students taking this
course are expected to read it before submitting the first
assignment. All assignments will provide instructions as to the
permissible forms of collaboration. The instructor must report any
infraction to the appropriate academic authorities.</P>
<P>The first infraction on an assignment/quiz/exam will result in an
automatic zero (0) points for that assignment/quiz/exam. Repeated
infractions will result in an 'F' grade for the course. Additional
penalties may be assessed through the academic honesty system of MSU.</P>
<P>It is your responsibility to understand and follow the academic
policy rules. If in doubt, cite the source, or ask your instructor in
advance.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><B>ADD-DROP POLICY</B></FONT></P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Add/drop without penalty</P>
	<P>A student has through the fifth class day into the semester to
	add a course and through the tenth class day to drop a course
	without being assessed a fee or academic penalty.</P>
	<LI><P>Drop after the tenth class day through the 30th class day
	into the semester</P>
	<P>A student who elects to drop a course during this period must
	receive the approval of his/her adviser, will be assigned a W on
	his/her academic record, and be assessed a fee. The adviser who
	permits the drop will specify its effective date.</P>
	<LI><P>Drop after the 30th class day into the semester</P>
	<P>A student cannot drop courses after this period except in
	documented cases of serious illness, extreme hardship, or failure of
	the instructor to provide significant assessment of his/her
	performance. A request to drop a course during this period must be
	approved by the student's adviser and academic dean. The dean who
	permits the drop will specify its effective date. A student
	receiving permission to drop will receive a W on his/her academic
	record and be assessed a fee.</P>
	<LI><P>Faculty are expected to provide a student with significant
	evidence or assessment of his/her class performance within the first
	six weeks.</P>
</OL>
<H2>Incomplete Grade</H2>
<P>A grade of I (&quot;incomplete&quot;) will not be granted EXCEPT
under those circumstances allowed by university policy. Approval must
be sought from the Computer Science department head for any
exceptions to this policy.</P>
