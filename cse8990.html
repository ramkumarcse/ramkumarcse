Any security solution involves overheads. Practical security solutions have
to ensure that the mandated overheads do not render the deployment unusable
or impractical. The overheads could take various forms - ranging from
computational, bandwidth, electrical energy (battery consumption), to 
storage. The costs associated with each resource are typically application
dependent. For example, in wired networks bandwidth may not be expensive,
while this is not the case for wireless networks. 

<P>
Efficient security solutions are especially challenging for emerging
application scenarios involving <b> ubiquitous and autonomic computing </b>.
Apart from constraints on resources like bandwidth, computation and storage,
another form of resource mandated for  ubiquitous computing applications
takes the form of providing assurances of <b> trustworthiness </b> of devices. 
<br> 
The main focus areas of this course are 
<ol>
<li> Qualitative investigation of resources, associated costs, and
security-resources trade-offs in traditional security solutions.
<li> Security solutions for resource constrained environments.
<li> Security issues in Ubiquitous and Autonomic Computing
<li> Strategies and technologies for realization of trustworthy devices.
</ol>
<br>  

The course will include investigation of traditional public key cryptographic
schemes, elliptic curve systems, and key pre-distribution schemes. 
Particular attention will be paid to issues in ubiquitous and autonomic 
computing and problems and solutions for read-proofing / tamper-resistance of
trustworthy computing chips. 


While a prior introduction to Cryptography is not a necessary pre-requisite for
this course, it can be helpful. The introductory lectures will include a
condensed introduction to Cryptography (material from References 1-3). At
the end of the introductory lectures the students will be tested on this
material (20 minute quiz).  
<P>
Selected technical papers, white papers and tutorial presentations from
the current literature will serve as the basis for this course.  The  list
of papers to be covered will be listed under the References section below. 
Every student is expected to <b> read all papers </b>, present them to the
class if called upon  to do so, and engage actively in discussions. 
<P> 
By the end of the first week of classes every student will be expected to
pick at least 3 of the 18 (from items 4 - 21 in the list below) papers
indicating first,
second and third choice, for presentation before the class. Each presentation
will last between 20-30 minutes.  Apart from the papers specifically assigned,
students picked will be picked at random will to provide brief introductions
to more in-depth presentations that follow.  Following each presentation,
randomly picked students will be asked to summarize the paper presented. 
<P>
<h3><a name="grap"> Grading Policy </a></h3> <br>
Grading for this course will be based on the 
<ol>
<li> T: attendance
<li> Q: One 20 minute quiz (15 points)
<li> L: level of participation in discussions  (35 points)
<li> P: individual presentations (50 points)
<li> O: Original ideas suitable for publication (upto 20 bonus points)
</ol>
The overall score (Q+L+P+O) will be <it> weighed by attendance </A> T. 
<br>
The final  score on which the assigned grades will be based  will be evaluated
as
<H5> Total Score = T(Q+L+P+O) </H5>
Students with <b> less than 90%
attendance will automatically forfeit any chance of getting an A grade </b>.
